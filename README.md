minimising the field-error integral with **Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)**
in MATLAB.

## Project context

This was my special assignment for **EE303 · Numerical Analysis** (Fall 2023,
University of Tripoli).  Specification highlights :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:

* Coil radius `a = 0.4 m`  
* Region of interest `±L = ±0.25 m`  
* Current per loop `I = 25 A`  
* `N_pairs = 8` loop pairs  
* Desired field `Bᶻ_desired(z) = 10⁻³ · z [T]`

The fitness function is the mean-square deviation between the
optimised field and the ideal linear field inside the ROI :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Repository structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **matlab/** | Unmodified source code (four `.m` files). |
| **docs/** | The original assignment brief for reference. |
| **results/** | Figures and numerical results generated by the code. |

## Running the code

```matlab
% MATLAB R2023 or newer
cd matlab
special              % runs PSO and plots field profile
````

After execution a vector `gbest` (optimised coil positions) and the final
fitness value are printed, and the field profile is plotted. Save the figure
into `results/` as `field_profile.png` and commit it.

## Key files

* **special.m** – main PSO driver (500 iterations, 25 particles).
* **integral.m** – Simpson’s 3/8 numerical integrator.
* **Bz.m** – magnetic-field model for an N-pair Maxwell-like coil .
* **test.m** – exhaustive search script used for validation.

## Why PSO?

PSO handles non-differentiable, multi-modal objectives elegantly and requires
only objective-function evaluations. A concise introduction is available
in Muhammad Saad Uddin’s article *“Implementing Particle Swarm Optimisation
from Scratch”* (Python in Plain English, 2022) – link:

## Results

The optimised coil pair positions reduced the integrated squared error to
≈ `1 × 10⁻⁸` T²·m. The plot above shows an almost perfect overlap between the
modelled and desired fields within the ±0.25 m ROI.
